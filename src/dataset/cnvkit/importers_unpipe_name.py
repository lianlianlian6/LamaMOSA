    by joining all labels with '|', e.g. 'BRAF|BRAF' -- no two distinct
    targeted genes actually overlap, though, so these dupes are redundant.
    Meaningless target names are dropped, e.g. 'CGH|FOO|-' resolves as 'FOO'.
    In case of ambiguity, the longest name is taken, e.g. "TERT|TERT Promoter"
    resolves as "TERT Promoter".
