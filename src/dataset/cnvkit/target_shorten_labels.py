    So: BED or interval_list files have a label for every region. We want this
    to be a short, unique string, like the gene name. But if an interval list is
    instead a series of accessions, including additional accessions for
    sub-regions of the gene, we can extract a single accession that covers the
    maximum number of consecutive regions that share this accession.
