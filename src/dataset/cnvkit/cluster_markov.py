    Each of the matrices in the resulting iterable (list) can be processed the

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : array
        Matrix of samples' read depths or normalized log2 values, as columns.
    inflation : float
        Inflation parameter for MCL. Must be >1; higher more granular clusters.
    by_pca : bool
        If true, similarity is by PCA; otherwise, by Pearson correlation.

    Return
    ------
    results : list
        A list of matrices representing non-overlapping column-subsets of the
        input, where each set of samples represents a cluster.
