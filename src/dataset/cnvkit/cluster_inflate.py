    From the mcl manual:

    This value is the main handle for affecting cluster granularity.
    This parameter is the usually only one that may require tuning.

    By default it is set to 2.0 and this is a good way to start. If you want to
    explore cluster structure in graphs with MCL, vary this parameter to obtain
    clusterings at different levels of granularity.  It is usually chosen
    somewhere in the range [1.2-5.0]. -I 5.0 will tend to result in fine-grained
    clusterings, and -I 1.2 will tend to result in very coarse grained
    clusterings. A good set of starting values is 1.4, 2, 4, and 6.
    Your mileage will vary depending on the characteristics of your data.

    Low values for -I, like -I 1.2, will use more CPU/RAM resources.

    Use mcl's cluster validation tools 'clm dist' and 'clm info' to test the
    quality and coherency of your clusterings.
